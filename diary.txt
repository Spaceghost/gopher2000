step one -- research

step two -- refine code base

step three -- largely start over from scratch
-- pull routing from sintatra
-- request model
-- lots of specs

simplify output code -- remove craziness that doesn't need to be there

split EM out as much as possible for better testing/future modifications

tweak output code to work, be clean and simple and DSL'ish

proper line endings, more refactoring

THEN... A long break to attend to other things

dispatching updates:
-- glob routes
-- default route
-- some more specs

people like browsing files, right? so, wrote a directory/file browser
as an external class so it can be extended easily


THEN:
- working on request/response objects -- put a response code into Response
- work on rendering/templating, make sure that params/request objects are available, etc
- added default error handlers and ability to add custom handlers
- implemented 404 handling and so on
- lots of specs


NEXT:
- logging
- docs
- working examples
- input/output sanitizing
