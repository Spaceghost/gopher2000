step one -- research

step two -- refine code base

step three -- largely start over from scratch
-- pull routing from sintatra
-- request model
-- lots of specs

simplify output code -- remove craziness that doesn't need to be there

split EM out as much as possible for better testing/future modifications

tweak output code to work, be clean and simple and DSL'ish

proper line endings, more refactoring

THEN... A long break to attend to other things

dispatching updates:
-- glob routes
-- default route
-- some more specs

NEXT: templating/menu code


=========

testing
input/output sanitizing
directory mounter

mount '/files' => '/home/colin/foo', :filter => '*.jpg'
